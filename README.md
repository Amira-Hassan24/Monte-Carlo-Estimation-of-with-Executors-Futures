# Monte-Carlo-Estimation-of-with-Executors-Futures
We will estimate the value of pi and e using a monte carlo simulation .first, build a sequential estimator and then a parallel estimator using excutor service , callable , and future. we will design our solution usig object-oriented principles and run experiments to compare runtime and accuracy using java and javaFX forGUI
